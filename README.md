# react-material-you

## DEPRECATION NOTICE
This project has been moved to the [material-u](https://github.com/daimond113/material-u) repo.

Since Google doesn't wanna do it, I will.

This is an implementation of Google's [Material You](https://m3.material.io) also known as Material Design 3.
It contains a set of beautiful components designed by Google to be used in your next React project.
